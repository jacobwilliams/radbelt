BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

	These empirical models describe the differential or
integral, omnidirectional fluxes of electrons (AE-8) and protons
(AP-8) in the inner and outer radiation belts (electrons: L=1.1 
to 11, protons: L=1.1 to 7) for two epochs representing solar 
maximum (1970) and minimum (1964) conditions. The energy spectrum 
ranges from 0.1 to 400 MeV for the protons and from 0.04 to 7 MeV 
for the electrons. AE-8 and AP-8 are the most recent ones in a 
series of models established by J. Vette and his colleges at NSSDC 
starting in the early sixties. The models are based on almost all 
available satellite data. It is IMPORTANT that the models maps for
solar maximum are used with a magnetic field model for epoch=1970
and for solar minimum for epoch=1964.
	For each epoch and particle the model consists of a three-
dimensional table of (logarithm of) particle fluxes in energy, L-value, 
and B/B0 (magnetic field strength normalized to the equator). The program 
MODEL finds the particle fluxes for given energy, L-value and B/B0 by 
interpolating in energy (subroutine TRARA1) and in L * B/B0 space (TRARA2). 
The program RADBELT produces tables of integral or differential fluxes
for different energies varying with L or B/B0.
	The coefficient files are provided in VAX/VMS binary (*.bin) and
ASCII (*.asc) format. For all systems other than VMS the use of the ASCII
files is recommended. If using the ASCII coefficient one needs to slightly 
modify the RADBELT.FOR program as described in a comment statement in
RADBELT (this comments are found after the OPEN statement for the coefficient 
file).
	In March 1995 the earlier used compressed model maps AP8MIC and AP8MAC
were replaced with the full maps AP8MIN/MAX with the help of D. Heynderickx 
(BIRA, Brussel, Belgium) and A. Beliaev (INP/MSU, Moscow, Russia). Heynderickx 
and Beliaev (1995) had found and corrected a small error in the AP8MIN map; 
two lines had been exchanged.
